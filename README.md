# Overwatch Workshop

A collection of workshop scripts used in [these videos](https://youtube.com/marblr).



# File Types

`.opy` files are [overpy](https://github.com/Zezombye/overpy) scripts; these are the "source" files that are compiled into usable workshop scripts.

`.txt` files are compiled workshop scripts; these can be pasted directly into the custom game menu.
